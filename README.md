# CUT - POAP Design

Welcome! Here are some of my artworks for CUT POAP Design

#### 1. Commemorative POAP for Earth Hour 2021, Making Ethereum mainnet green
**Challenge Description:** 
As another great example of the kind of things that can be done with CUT, the second POAP weâ€™d like to see submissions on, is a commemorative POAP of our event on Earth Hour of 2021. During that hour, we calculated the carbon footprint of the Ethereum Network, and retired enough of our Offset tokens (2.7M CUT) to make the entire mainnet carbon neutral for that hour. As with all of our POAPs we encourage broad freedoms in creativity, we remain open to any and all types of submissions!

#### 2. ETHDenver hackathon POAP, February 2022
**Challenge Description:**
We wanted to have a POAP for ETH Denver, February 2022, an event we've attended previously. It was such an impressive atmosphere, providing years worth of t-shirts and swag, and enough fresh ideas and innovative projects to last several lifetimes.

#### 3. Future milestone of 1M total tonnes of Carbon Offsets added to CUT
**Challenge Description:** 
When we first started CUT we were coming up with ideas how to start, how many offsets we need, and to what level we needed to keep growing. This future POAP is for the community celebration when we break that barrier and have officially made 1M tonnes available via CUT.

#### 4. Retiring 5 million kgs of Carbon Offsets using CUT for POAPathon 2021
**Challenge Description:** 
We've decided, in addition to being sponsors for POAPathon 2021, to also make a significant burning / retirement event of carbon tokens (CUT) to make this event Carbon Neutral. This is to offset items such as any new POAPs minted at the event, the data needs of various sessions of live art, streaming, and other general Ops of the event. Although many of these exact footprint items will not be known perfectly in advance of the conclusion of POAPathon, we are making a massive over estimation and retiring 5 Million kgs using CUT. This challenge is for design of the POAP for carbon neutralizing POAPathon :)

#### 5. Event For Release Of The CUT Self-Retire App
**Challenge Description:**
With the fast approaching release of our CUT retirement app, which will allow users to go onto the web app and action these token retirements of carbon, we have decided to create a POAP surrounding the near term future release of the retirement app.
